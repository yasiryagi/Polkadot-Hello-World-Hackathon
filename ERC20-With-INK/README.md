[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/burgerking12/Front-End-Javascript-Polkadot)


Setup instructions can be found at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started).

This template allows you to create a front-end application that connects to a
[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) node back-end with minimal
configuration. To learn about Substrate itself, visit the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev).

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the node template. This command will build the
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

## Using The Template

### Installation

The codebase is installed using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). This tutorial assumes you have installed yarn globally prior to installing it within the subdirectories. For the most recent version and how to install yarn, please refer to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) documentation and installation guides. 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/burgerking12/Front-End-Javascript-Polkadot.git
cd ./substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```
## Usage

You can start the template in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.
